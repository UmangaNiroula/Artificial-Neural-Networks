# Breast Cancer Detection using Neural Networks and Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning and neural network techniques to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Through data preprocessing, outlier handling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we clean and prepare the dataset for training a neural network model built with Keras and TensorFlow. The model, which includes three dense hidden layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting, achieved 98.6% accuracy on the training data and 100% on the validation set. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning for early breast cancer detection, potentially aiding in faster and more accurate diagnoses.
